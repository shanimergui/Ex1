## About the project:

The project's subject is about a weighted and undirected graph composed of edges that are connecting to the vertices, and are neighbours.

## The classes:

There are 4 classes and in each one an interface : 
1) Edgeinfo(), with edge_info interface.
2) Nodeinfo(), with node_info interface.
3) WGraph_DS, weighted_graph interface 
4) WGraph_Algo, weighted_graph_algorithms interface.



A) Class edge_info is an edge class containing the edge's weight and information.

B) Class node_info is a private intern class inside of WGraph_DS class, graph's vertex.

C) Class WGraphDS is building the graph with Edgeinfo and Nodeinfo 

D) Class WGraph_Algo is calculating all the complex figures required in the graph.

Here is an example for a weighted and undirected graph.
